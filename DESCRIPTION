Description: The impactr package consolidates functionality from a range of existing packages
    (including rcrossref, rAltmetric, scholar) into holistic and practical quantifications
    of biomedical research impact. These functions have a range of applications from generating publication
    lists to quantifying research impact by combining traditional metrics (citations, journal impact factor),
    with newer impact metrics such as co-authorship networks and social media presence.
